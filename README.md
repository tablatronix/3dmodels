Tslot bench organizer system I designed for my small work bench, It is high density, and uses 2020 aluminum t-slot extrusions
it suspends the rail from the wall and allows mounting parts on all 4 sides. 

The mounts are made to hold the rail on top or bottom only, so that an led strip (11mm?) can be ran through it. 
It is also made to be maintained, as the entire thing can be removed from the wall without removing the mounts.

You can run an led strip on any of 3 sides ( which ever sided you are not using to mount ), 
I recommend using captive slide in nuts for slot mounts, and not the twist insert ones. 
I think I used steel washers inside the wall mount holes to distribute the force when screwing them in.

This is a work in progress, and was made for my personal use, and have low iterations.
